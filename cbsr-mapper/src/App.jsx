// banner, a proxy input box, and a red CORS error under the run button — is exactly the
// wrong thing to have on screen while presenting.

// extractor over the same six feature flags the manual checkboxes already set, and the

// tension, resolution channel, binding status). So the map flow runs end to end, offline,

// back. Every other view (corridors, matrix, time-travel, substrate, agents, exports)

// ── Corridor evidence discipline ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// A corridor leg carries the same contract as a node record: a field is either
// VERIFIED (a value, backed by leg.evidence_tier and the corridor's sources) or
// ABSENT (null), with the gap declared structurally in leg.pending. There is no
// third state, and in particular no placeholder text sitting in the value slot
// where a finding is supposed to sit — an unverified leg must not be readable, by
// a human or an agent, as if it were a finding.
//
// isPlaceholder() is the legacy backstop. Earlier revisions inlined angle-bracket
// VERIFY markers into the value slot. The invariant below fails the build if one
// returns; the guard stays so that a stale dataset still degrades honestly rather
// than printing the raw marker.
//
// The [<] character class is deliberate and load-bearing — do NOT "simplify" it back
// to a bare "<". scripts/check-invariants.mjs --dist greps the built bundle for that
// exact marker, and Vite bundles regex literals verbatim. Written the obvious way, the
// detector emits its own detection pattern into dist/ and the build fails on the guard
// itself: "placeholder in built asset", while the data is in fact clean. [<]VERIFY
// matches identically at runtime but never appears as that substring in the source, so
// the real check keeps its teeth. (Same trick as `ps aux | grep '[s]shd'`.)
